# 💻 Java System Simulation

> **Object-oriented simulation of real-world systems.**
> Focuses on object lifecycle management, input validation, and robust error handling.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Core Concepts**: OOP, I/O Streams, Exception Handling

## 🚀 Key Learnings & Implementations
* **Object Modeling**: Mapped real-world entities (e.g., Electronic Components, Blackjack Cards) to Java classes.
* **Robust Input Parsing**: Developed validation logic to handle unexpected user inputs and prevent runtime crashes.
* **Circuit Simulation**: Created a `Resistor-Circuit-Model` to calculate total resistance in parallel/series circuits programmatically.
* **Game Logic**: Implemented the core logic for a Blackjack game, managing state and probability.

## 📂 Modules
- `Resistor-Circuit-Model/`: Electronics circuit calculation engine.
- `Object-Lifecycle-Manager/`: Demonstrations of constructor/destructor patterns.
- `Blackjack-Game-Simulation/`: Interactive console-based game logic.
